<h3>Chapter: Advanced Tree Structures</h3>
<p>This chapter explores tree structures beyond basic binary trees, focusing on AVL trees, red-black trees, B-trees, and tries.  We will analyze their self-balancing properties, applications, and performance characteristics, enabling you to choose the appropriate structure for various problems.</p>

<h4>1. AVL Trees</h4>
<p>AVL trees are self-balancing binary search trees.  The balance factor of each node (the height difference between its left and right subtrees) must be -1, 0, or 1.  To maintain this balance, rotations are performed upon insertion or deletion. </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Self-Balancing Property:</strong>  Understand how the balance factor ensures logarithmic time complexity for operations.</li>
  <li><strong>Rotations:</strong>  Master the implementation of single and double rotations (left-left, left-right, right-left, right-right) to rebalance the tree.</li>
  <li><strong>Time Complexity Analysis:</strong> Analyze the time complexity of insertion, deletion, and search operations (all O(log n)).  Illustrate with examples.</li>
  <li><strong>Example Implementations (pseudocode or snippets):</strong>  Show examples of insertion and deletion, highlighting rotation logic.</li>
</ul>


<h4>2. Red-Black Trees</h4>
<p>Red-black trees are another type of self-balancing binary search tree.  They use color (red or black) to maintain balance, ensuring logarithmic time complexity. Unlike AVL trees, they allow for a slightly less strict balance, resulting in fewer rotations during updates, potentially leading to faster performance in some scenarios.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Properties of Red-Black Trees:</strong>  Understand the five properties that define a valid red-black tree (root, external nodes, red node properties, black height).</li>
  <li><strong>Insertion and Deletion:</strong> Implement insertion and deletion algorithms, including color adjustments and rotations as needed. Emphasize the handling of different cases and the maintenance of red-black properties.</li>
  <li><strong>Comparison with AVL Trees:</strong>  Compare and contrast the performance characteristics of AVL and red-black trees. Discuss scenarios where one might be preferred over the other.</li>
  <li><strong>Example Implementations (pseudocode or snippets):</strong> Provide examples demonstrating insertion and deletion with color changes and rotations.</li>
</ul>


<h4>3. B-Trees</h4>
<p>B-trees are designed for disk-based systems, where disk access is significantly slower than memory access. They minimize disk I/O operations by storing multiple keys and children in each node.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Structure and Functionality:</strong> Explain the structure of a B-tree node (keys, children), the minimum and maximum degree, and how keys are ordered within nodes.</li>
  <li><strong>B-Tree Operations:</strong>  Implement insertion and deletion operations, focusing on splitting and merging nodes to maintain the B-tree properties. Emphasize the impact on disk I/O efficiency.</li>
  <li><strong>Performance Benefits in Databases:</strong> Discuss how B-trees are crucial for efficient data retrieval in database systems by minimizing the number of disk accesses.</li>
  <li><strong>Example Implementations (pseudocode or snippets):</strong>  Provide examples demonstrating insertion and deletion, highlighting node splitting and merging.</li>
</ul>


<h4>4. Tries</h4>
<p>Tries (prefix trees) are tree-like data structures used for efficient string searching and prefix matching.  Each node represents a character, and paths from the root to a leaf represent strings.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Implementation:</strong>  Explain the implementation of a trie, including the structure of nodes (character, children, isEndOfWord flag).</li>
  <li><strong>String Searching and Prefix Matching:</strong> Demonstrate how to efficiently search for strings and find all strings with a given prefix using a trie.</li>
  <li><strong>Time Complexity Analysis:</strong> Analyze the time complexity of various trie operations (insertion, search, prefix matching).  Highlight the advantages compared to other string searching techniques.</li>
  <li><strong>Applications:</strong> Discuss applications of tries in autocompletion, spell checkers, and other string-related tasks.</li>
  <li><strong>Example Implementations (pseudocode or snippets):</strong>  Show examples of insertion, search, and prefix matching operations.</li>
</ul>


<h4>5. Advanced Tree Traversal Algorithms</h4>
<p>This section expands on standard tree traversal techniques. We explore their iterative and recursive implementations and analyze their time and space complexities.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Preorder, Inorder, Postorder Traversal:</strong> Review these classic traversal algorithms and provide iterative and recursive implementations.</li>
  <li><strong>Level-Order Traversal (Breadth-First Search):</strong> Implement level-order traversal using a queue.</li>
  <li><strong>Depth-First Search (DFS):</strong>  Explain how preorder, inorder, and postorder traversals are all forms of DFS and their applications.</li>
  <li><strong>Time and Space Complexity Analysis:</strong> Compare the time and space complexity of each algorithm.</li>
  <li><strong>Example Implementations (pseudocode or snippets):</strong>  Provide code examples for each traversal algorithm in at least one of the iterative or recursive styles.</li>
</ul>
